# SARS-CoV-2-Sequence-Analysis
This part of the project involves a detailed analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The task includes investigating SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 20 countries with the highest number of reported cases. The focus is on comparing the differences between populations, such as Asian, Hispanic, European, and African.

The script calculates the DNA base lengths for the selected virus variants and provides a visual comparison. A phylogenetic tree is generated to study the relationships between the virus sequences and other related coronaviruses. Additionally, graphical representations of the DNA base lengths and the phylogenetic tree are included to enhance the analysis.

Finally, the script includes a written interpretation of the results, offering conclusions based on the visualizations and research conducted during the investigation.
